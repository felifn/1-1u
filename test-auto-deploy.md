# Auto-Deployment Test

This file is used to test if automatic deployments are working.

## Current Status
- **Repository:** felifn/1-1u ✅ Connected
- **Vercel Automation:** ✅ All enabled
- **Connection Time:** 16 minutes ago
- **Auto-deploy:** Should trigger on this push

## Test Deployment
This commit should automatically trigger a new Vercel deployment.

## Expected Results
1. Push this commit
2. Vercel should detect the push automatically
3. New deployment should start within 1-2 minutes
4. Site should update with gothic favicon

## Favicon Status
- ✅ Gothic "RUINED" favicon with cracks
- ✅ Tab title: "RUINED"
- ✅ Cache busting: v=4
- ✅ Multiple icon formats

**If this works, auto-deployment is fixed!**
