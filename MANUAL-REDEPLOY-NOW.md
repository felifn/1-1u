# ðŸš¨ MANUAL REDEPLOY - GET YOUR CHANGES LIVE NOW!

## **Your auto-deployment isn't working, but here's how to fix it immediately:**

### **Step 1: Go to Your Project**
1. **Click on your project:** `v0-ruined-clothing-website`
2. **This will open your project dashboard**

### **Step 2: Force Redeploy**
1. **Click "Deployments" tab** (at the top)
2. **Find the latest deployment** (the one from 11 minutes ago)
3. **Click the three dots (â‹®) menu** on that deployment
4. **Click "Redeploy"**
5. **Wait 2-5 minutes** for deployment to complete

### **Step 3: Alternative - New Deployment**
1. **Click "Deployments" tab**
2. **Click the "Deploy" button** (usually at the top)
3. **Select "Deploy from Git"**
4. **Choose your repository:** `felifn/1-1u`
5. **Click "Deploy"**

## **What You'll Get:**
âœ… **Gothic "RUINED" favicon** with cracks and texture  
âœ… **Tab title: "RUINED"**  
âœ… **Shop authentication links**  
âœ… **All your updates**  

## **Why This Happened:**
- Your Vercel project is connected to the right repository
- But the webhook isn't detecting new commits
- Manual redeploy will force it to use the latest code

## **After Redeploy:**
- **Check your live site:** www.ruinedclothing.shop
- **Look at browser tab** - should show "RUINED" and gothic logo
- **All changes will be live!**

**Do Step 2 (Redeploy) - it's the fastest way to get your changes live!**
